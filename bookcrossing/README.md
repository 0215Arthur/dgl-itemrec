Please download the bookcrossing dataset from [here](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/).

The dataset contains user information, book information and users' rating. Ideally, we need to have book content to generate richer features. The book content can be download from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1u7I8k9KplHQAsDm1qDW0v2FeDDfYs7PS).

We can generate book features from the book content dataset with sparse bag-of-words with the tokenize.sh script.
